# AskPassGen

###### Generator of passwords list based on data retrieved from the victim/target.

## How it works?

###### The script will ask you a few questions about the target, and from the information provided, it will generate passwords based on that, and more, the script has a "mini-database" of similar letters to other so in an intelligent way the generated passwords cover all possibilities. For example, "Kevin" would become "Kev1m", however the script systematically generates passwords for each similarity and not only all at once.

## Features:
1. Generates passwords list.
2. Checks likeness of letters in words.
3. Generates passwords also based on similarities.
4. Generates passwords with special characters as well.
5. Generate passwords with standards commonly used by people. (the standards were collected through a private study)
6. **(LAUNCHED - PROMISE MADE IS FULFILLED PROMISE)** Possibility of using command line arguments.
7. **(SOON/MAY/POSSIBLY)** Possibility to withdraw the information automatically from the target's facebook.

## Requirements:
1. Python 3.4
2. Windows or any Unix based system. (Linux, Mac, etc)
3. At least 500MB on HD to store the passwords list.
4. Dual-Core CPU, maybe slowly with just one core. :)
5. Social Engineering is essential. 

## Message:
This script was inspired by Mr.Robot (The Series), because in an ep of the season, the main character uses a script similar to this to generate passwords.

## Contributions:
I believe that everyone is welcome to contribute to this script anyway. If you happen to have more ideas of similarities or special characters, please create an issue/pull request here on github and i will add as soon as possible.
